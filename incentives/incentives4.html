                <h2>The Purpose of the System</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    “The purpose of the system is what it does.” Stafford Beer
                </blockquote>
                <p></p>
                <p>We have spent the last few sections pointing out some flaws in the electoral feedback loop. We must acknowledge, however, that these things are only shortcomings for a system if they prevent a system from achieving its purpose. It would be foolish to criticise a barista for failing to provide you with good legal advice – and perhaps we are asking too much of the electoral system. We may have been uncharitable to presume that the purpose of the electoral system is to ensure that a country is governed according to the national interest, or to ensure that the electorate’s interests are precisely and effectively transmitted to state actors. So, what is the purpose of the electoral feedback loop?</p>
                <p>When we describe a system, we must make a distinction between normative and descriptive claims. </p>
                <p><b>Normative statements:</b> A statement is normative if it contains some implication of value or what ought to be done – it contains judgement or imperatives to act. For example: “the university system is supposed to produce graduates with useful skills for the job market” or “the coin toss was unfair.”</p>
                <p><b>Descriptive statements:</b> Descriptive statements are dispassionate; they describe what is but not what ought to be. For example: “the university system trains students in skills such as analytical research and teamworking” or “the coin toss was called after the result had been revealed.”</p>
                <p>When we describe what a system does, this is non-normative. When we describe what a system ought to do, in other words its purpose, this is normative. For many human made systems, their purpose is defined relative to the creator of that system; the creator has intentionally designed the system for a specific goal. Many systems, human made or otherwise, also have purpose relative to their participants or users –the system may not have been created for that particular purpose, but those who use the system or participate in the system do so because it yields a particular result for them. Systems can have multiple purposes, and different purposes for different people. When we talk about purpose of the system then, we should always caveat the notion of purpose with “for whom?”</p>
                <p>A popular heuristic for systems thinkers is that the purpose of the system is what it does. This can be interpreted in a few different ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is pointless to talk about what the creator intended as the purpose, the purpose of the system can be found in its outputs, not its stated intentions. </li>
                    <li>Normative talk of purpose is pointless – systems do things and speaking of purpose adds nothing to the description of the system.</li>
                    <li>Some systems have no purpose, as they are not intentionally created or participated in – and the results they yield are therefore not intentionally yielded and so have no normative purpose, and thus only a non-normative description remains.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>How the electoral system came to be</h3>
                <p>Our electoral system is not one that can claim to have been intentionally designed at a particular point in time to achieve specific goals, unlike many younger democracies and republics. Our electoral system is a product of evolved systems through time: from the first Parliament in the 13th century, the English civil war and Glorious Revolution in the 17th, increasing sovereignty of Parliament in the 18th, and expansions of the electoral franchise in the 19th and early 20th century. Each change to our constitutional settlement along the way has had its own motivations, but the overall settlement and system we have today is a product of political compromises and events rather than a system designed for specific ends.</p>
                
                <h3>What the electoral system does</h3>
                <p>At its core, our electoral system ensures that the power to govern in this country is peacefully transferred between different elite factions depending upon the sentiment of the electorate. It serves to check and moderate the law making and executive powers of any individual faction, and gives the electorate the ability to remove particularly unpopular factions from power. It does not enable the electorate to choose who they will be governed by, but does enable them to choose who they would rather not be governed by. By this I mean that the first past the post system, absent national crisis, guarantees a two-party system and that the electorate realistically only has a choice between these two parties at each election. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, control over party vehicles is fiercely contested by different elite factions, according to different rulesets and arguably less democratic processes. Of course, these parties do very occasionally change in periods of significant social change or crisis, and arguably we are undergoing such a change right now, but when the dust settles it will be a system dominated by two parties. You don’t back the third runner in a two-horse race.</p>
                <p>When people talk about feedback loops, they often make a distinction between reinforcing feedback loops and balancing loops. </p>
                <p><b>Reinforcing feedback loops:</b> A reinforcing loop compounds over time such that positive feedback encourages better performance, which receives positive feedback and so on. A classic example is interest on a bank savings balance. The interest earnt increases the balance, which subsequently increases the next interest payment, increasing the balance and so forth.</p>
                <p><b>Balancing feedback loops:</b> A balancing feedback loop is one where feedback causes things to move towards an equilibrium state. For example, as your body temperature goes up, your body sweats to cool you and bring the temperature back down – and vice versa with temperature going down and shivering.</p>
                <p>In a free and democratic electoral system, we know from experience that there is something more akin to a balancing loop (at least between the different formal parties or candidates). The adage that all political careers end in failure pays homage to this idea. Parties (and the factions within them) win power and elections, they govern for a period, and then they are thrown out. Usually, the throwing out part follows the state of the country having recently taken a turn for the worse, often due to some external shocks.</p>

               <h2>Change in a balancing system</h2> 
                <p>If the electoral system is a balancing system, then we might reasonably ask how political change happens. The key here is to understand that systems operate in environments, and that the narrow electoral feedback loop is not the only system in play. The environment has impacts on the system, and, if we consciously wield it, the power gained through the electoral system can impact the environment in which it works.</p>
                <p>To help wrap our heads around this, let us take a moment to look at an example in the natural world. In a contained island ecosystem, there is a natural balance between predator and prey populations, which reach a natural equilibrium. The predator keeps the prey population in check, whilst the prey population sustains the predator population as a food source. If the predator population grows too large and as a result reduces the prey population, then the predator population will shrink without enough food to sustain it – leading to the prey population once again growing and restoring equilibrium. Now imagine that a new predator is introduced to the ecosystem, who preys upon our original predator species’ eggs. We will expect a new equilibrium to emerge, which finds a new balance in population numbers between our original prey, egg-laying predator and the new egg-eating predator. Although the system of dependency between predator and prey was balancing around an equilibrium, the introduction of a new variable means that this system will find a new equilibrium point.</p>
                <p>In our natural example above, there is a slight difference that is important to note. We do not tend to imagine most systems as having intentional participants operating within them, who are capable of rigging the system in their favour. By this I mean that we imagine that those environmental changes which move the equilibrium are generally thought to be exogenous and unplanned shocks. The environment in which the electoral system operates is also impacted by exogenous shocks, but, if we understand the workings of the system well enough – we can also yield results by intentionally introducing system shocks. </p>
                <p>Let us look at some key historic changes to our system, some intentional and some not:/p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Working class and then women’s suffrage – these changes moved the electorate’s equilibrium point, prompting changes in the parties’ pitches to meet the electorate and, arguably, a change in which two parties our two-party system comprised.</li>
                    <li>The two world wars – both exogenous shocks which, in this case, fundamentally changed the nature of the state. The wars created a larger state and a degree of dependency on state control and provision of goods and services which has stuck.</li>
                    <li>The ceding of authority to foreign and domestic institutions – arguably an intentional move - removing powers from the direct sphere of control of parliament and so creating a degree of separation from the electoral system. Notably, a not insignificant ceding of control to non-domestic institutions was reversed with the Brexit vote in 2016.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>From these examples we can see three different methods to alter the environment in which the electoral system works. This is not an exhaustive list, but a useful starting point.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Move the equilibrium of the electorate so that the parties must move with it, via:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Changing the people who comprise the electorate</li>
                            <li>Changing the biases of the electorate (e.g. through control of information and education systems).</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>Exogenous shock therapy – the requirement of radical change to the state due to existential threats/crises, which can be used to cement such changes in the state. These changes are not possible without crisis, but once made form the basis for a new equilibrium.</li>
                    <li>Strip power from the electoral participants and hand it over to systems operating outside of the electoral system – such that changes can henceforth be reinforcing and not disrupted by the balancing mechanism of elections. </li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>It is not enough to win elections and move the needle for five years when your opposition are not just moving the needle, they are tipping the scales. </p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The electoral feedback loop alone does not create long-term change; it creates balance around an equilibrium and facilitates peaceful handovers of power.  </li>
                    <li>Fundamental and long-term change tends to be driven by changes to the electorate, exogenous shocks or strengthening/weakening of the electoral feedback loop. </li>
                    <li>If you are hoping for a system level feedback loop that drives progress, you need to look beyond the electoral cycle and to the environmental equilibrium around which our electoral system swings.</li>
                </ul>
