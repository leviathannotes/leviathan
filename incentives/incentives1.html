                <h1>Part 1: The Nature of Public Sector Risk</h1>
                
                <p><blockquote><i>“Committees are commonly used in our society because they create the illusion of avoiding risk. They are a wonderful device for avoiding responsibility while making the institution seem more rather than less accountable. Modern institutions have overloaded on actual risk while fleeing the appearance of it…”</blockquote> Samo Burja (Great Founder Theory)</i></p>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                
                <p>When we think of risk, we usually think only of downside risk. The risk that something goes wrong. With this mindset, it is easy to get into the habit of always wanting to minimise and eliminate risks. Risk is not a one-way street however, as greater risk can also be accompanied by greater reward. To have an intelligent conversation about risk, we should think of risk as just a measure of outcome variance. The greater the risk, the greater the variance in outcomes – for better and for worse. </p>
                <p>Let us look at a very simplified example. In the diagram below, the black arrow represents the level of returns – these could be financial or some other success measure for outcomes. We have two approaches shown. Approach A (purple) shows high risk aversion and approach B (blue) shows high risk tolerance. The stars show the average return for that approach, and the arrows beneath the level of variability. A on average performs worse than B, however, there is much less variability in A’s performance – risk aversion aims for low variability. B on average performs better, however, there is a much higher degree of variability, i.e. it is higher risk. Importantly, the worst possible result for blue is lower than the worst possible result for A. In many cases, at least up to a point, those who tolerate higher risk will on average get better results than those who tolerate lower risk. </p>
                
                <img src="part1.png" alt="Risk diagram" class="centered-image">
                
                <p>If the above is true, then why not always go for the higher risk approach if it fairs better on average?  We need to consider our tolerance for risk. Let us imagine that the point marked X on the above diagram is the absolute minimum return that you can tolerate. Anything less is catastrophic for you – you go out of business or perhaps there is a global nuclear apocalypse. In this case, you would be much more concerned about your exposure to downside risk, and less concerned with the upside or the average outcome. If you cannot tolerate downside risk or have minimum required returns, then your goal moves from maximising the average outcome to minimising the very bad outcomes. </p>
                
                <h2>Downside Risk in the Public Sector</h2>
                <p>For many activities in the public sector, it is more important to minimise downside risk than to maximise outcomes more generally. This is primarily driven by the severity of downside outcomes. The severity of downside outcome is driven by at least two factors – dependency and intrusiveness.</p>
                <h3>Dependency on public goods</h3>
                <p>Compared to many of their private counterparts, there is a high level of dependency on public goods. The dependency is driven by both the necessity of some public goods, and the lack of alternatives for these goods should public provision fail. </p>
                <p>Necessity: some publicly provided goods are necessities for those who consume them. If they are not provided then very bad things happen. For example, healthcare provision. If people do not have access to healthcare, then their lives’ will end prematurely and the quality of people’s lives will be much worse.</p>
                <p>Lack of alternatives: where public goods are monopolies, either naturally or through force, there is a lack of alternatives to the public provision. For example, underground broadband networks. It is generally not economically viable for more than one infrastructure network to operate in any given area – and this means that should that network suffer an outage, there are no like for like alternatives for those who rely on it. </p>
                <p>Should public provision for any one individual fail in the two examples above, the results need not be catastrophic. Healthcare is a necessity; however, one could seek a private healthcare alternative if the public provision was unsatisfactory.  If your broadband network fails, this would be a shame, however, it would not necessarily be catastrophic. Most people can get by just fine without fast internet for a few weeks. When necessity and a lack of alternatives are combined however, there is a high dependency on goods such that a failure of provision is catastrophic. For example, if we revisit the healthcare scenario and suppose that there are no private alternatives as the public provision has suffocated the private sector provision – then should public provision fail at scale, the consequences would be catastrophic as there would be insufficient alternatives to cope with the demand. Another example is policing. There are no (legal) alternatives to the police for the enforcement of law and order on our streets, and where policing is inadequate or absent, communities must go without and suffer lawlessness such as thievery and violence – with all the terrible consequences that entails.</p>
                <P>High dependency on public goods, driven by necessity of the goods and the lack of alternatives to the public provision, means that there is very high downside risk associated with the provision of those goods. When things go wrong, the results can be catastrophic – much worse than simply losing a bit of money. This means that the people and organisations responsible for providing these goods must adopt a very different attitude to risk.</P>
                <h4>Example: the impact of dependency on trade-offs. </h4>
                <P> Dependency creates bias towards minimising bad outcomes when it comes to trade-offs between minimising the bad and maximising the good. For example, let us look at the administration of welfare payments to the disabled who are genuinely unable to work. The outcome you are aiming for is to provide welfare payments only to those who are genuinely unable to work. There are two things you need to minimise – firstly the number of people you wrongly exclude, and secondly the number of people you wrongly include. Unfortunately, these two tend to be trade-offs as the stricter the criteria the more you wrongly exclude and the less you wrongly include, and vice versa for lax criteria. In the case of this service, due to the near absolute dependency of the genuinely disabled on the welfare payment, it is worse to wrongfully exclude one person than wrongfully include one person. The cost of wrongful inclusion is financial, whereas the cost of wrongful exclusion can be existential for those excluded. Therefore, the service will be designed in such a way that the avoidance of wrongful exclusions is prioritised. </P>
                <h3>Intrusiveness of state activities</h3>
                <p>The state does things that private actors cannot legitimately do without your consent. It can take your money, imprison you, spy on you, make decisions which materially impact your quality of life and even send you to war. The powers of the state are incredibly intrusive into your private life, and far beyond what you would ever accept from a non-state actor who does not have a monopoly of force (and hopefully also the legitimacy and authority to use it). </p>
                <p>With great power comes great responsibility, and the state’s intrusion into our lives require a greater level of consideration and oversight than that of private actors who are policed by our consent. The degree of power that the state holds over our lives means that, should the state be immoral or incompetent, the outcomes can be catastrophic. The downside risk of most private enterprises is bankruptcy, where the downside risk for states can be things like destroying millions of people’s opportunity to own a home, systematic health defects, wrongful imprisonment of innocents, mass casualties in war, or mass unemployment and hyperinflation. The stakes are different, and the tolerance for these extreme downside outcomes is much lower than tolerance for things like bankruptcy. The public sector approach to risk, and downside risk in particular, is therefore very different than to most private enterprises. </p>

                <h2>Legalisation and the Drive to Process Over Capability</h2>
                <P>One of the primary ways that risk is managed in the public sector is through a shift to process over outcomes. By this I mean that public sector actors are incentivised to follow processes and avoid using their own judgement and discretion. The benefits for those operating in the public sector are threefold: </P>
                <p> <ul> 
                    <li>1.	Public sector environments, especially on contentious issues, are heavily legalised. Where judgements have established precedence, it is convenient for public sector actors to follow the processes set out to shield themselves with or from the law. </li>
                    <li>2.	Individual public sector actors can absolve themselves of responsibility by following prescribed process and avoiding their own judgement, so that should things go wrong the process is to blame rather than their own decisions. </li>
                    <li>3.	If risks are known beforehand, and some public sector actors are incompetent and incapable of good judgement, mandating process can guard against extreme downside risks caused by personal incompetence.  </li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>A focus on process comes with trade-offs. </p>
                <p> <ul> 
                    <li>1.	Processes must generalise to some degree and so are incapable of handling edge or novel cases, and, as the environment and context changes over time, processes need constant revision to remain useful even for non-edge cases.</li>
                    <li>2.	Processes cannot maximise outcomes, which requires taking each case/problem individually and applying good judgement. Processes simply decrease potential for variability, including upside variability.</li>
                    <li>3.	Processes enable the diffusion of responsibility, which negatively impacts accountability and incentives.</li>
                    <li>4.	Even where process is prescribed merely as guidance, and actors are allowed discretion, the existence of process creates a strong incentive for actors not to deviate from process as they open themselves to personal liability should their decision lead to worse outcomes than the process – such a liability is not worthwhile if there is no personal upside should their decision lead to a better outcome.</li>
                    <li>5.	Competent public sector workers have their agency removed and handed over to process – for the most public spirited and motivated workers, a lack of agency is morale destroying. The long term are effects are that those who enter public service become demotivated and cynical, compounding to create a cultural issue within public organisations where people do not have a strong interest in outcomes. This not an attack on public sector workers; it’s very difficult to take a strong interest in outcomes over which you have little control – just ask any serious sports fan who has their weekend ruined when their favourite team loses.  </li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>Although it is within the points above, I will emphasise again what I believe is the chief problem with a process driven culture. Incentives. A process driven culture removes incentives from individual actors. The more you straightjacket actors with rules and process, the less responsibility they have for the outcomes of their actions – their actions are no longer theirs, rather they just become a medium through which actions occur. It is not implausible that this sometimes is a price worth paying, especially where the judgement of those actors is poor. However, there is a trade-off to acknowledge and there can be no absolution of responsibility – process must be consciously chosen, not defaulted to, and the architects of the process must be held responsible for outcomes. Responsibility cannot be absolved or somehow lost somewhere between those who design the process and those who execute upon those designs.</p>
                <h2>Sensationalism and Politicisation</h2>
                <p>Public sector actors generally operate in a more unforgiving and agenda driven media environment than private actors, and this discourages risk taking. The “Daily Mail test” is a common refrain to roadblock any novel or innovative ideas where there is a risk of public failure, and mediocre performance is often preferred to excellent performance if it comes with any associated risk of public failure. Not only is there greater scrutiny on the public than private, the scrutiny is often politically motivated and biased. This not only impacts approaches to risks, but also approaches to outcomes. Public sector actors have an incentive to prioritise appearances over outcomes. </p>

                <h2>Summary: The Nature of Public Sector Risk</h2>
                <p>The nature of many state activities, including their intrusiveness and the dependency placed upon them, means that there is a greater degree of downside risk than in most private activities – creating a risk averse culture.</p>
                <p>Risk aversion is accentuated by sensationalism and politicisation of scrutiny, which is rarely impartial or charitable.</p>
                <p>Public servants have incentives to favour a process driven culture, however, such a culture comes with significant trade-offs.</p>
                <p>Process should not absolve responsibility; where process is favoured over individual discretion and responsibility, we must hold accountable the individuals responsible for a process.</p>
